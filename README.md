In this example about to assign the other object's position directly (move to Red Sphere) and Lerp using (move to Blue Sphere), MoveTowards using (move to Yellow Sphere). An example demonstration of how to switch states that transition between using enum.

The lerp is used to move from one object to another by smoothing it more slowly than instantly. It is fast at the beginning but eventually slows down to the end point.

MoveTowards progresses from start to end stably according to the given speed.

And these pictures, the Cube's start and end point.

Note: I assigned my 3 Spheres to an array.
